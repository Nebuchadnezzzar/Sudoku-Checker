# Sudoku-Checker

**A tiny program validating a traditional 9x9 Sudoku.**

Sudoku requires that every row, column and 3x3 square contain
all digits from 1 to 9. As no duplicates are allowed, no rows, columns or regions can be identical.
The program accepts Python matrix with 9 lists consisting of 9 elements as an input.
